# TypeScript, GraphQL, Next.js + Chakra UI boilerplate.

One of the strengths of GraphQL is [enforcing data types on runtime](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Value-Completion). Further, TypeScript and [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) (graphql-codegen) make it safer by typing data statically, so you can write truly type-protected code with rich IDE assists.

This template extends [Apollo Server and Client Example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/api-routes-apollo-server-and-client#readme) by rewriting in TypeScript and integrating [graphql-let](https://github.com/piglovesyou/graphql-let#readme), which runs [TypeScript React Apollo](https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/plugins/typescript-react-apollo) in [graphql-codegen](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator#readme) under the hood. It enhances the typed GraphQL use as below:

```tsx
import { useNewsQuery } from './news.graphql'

const News = () => {
	// Typed already️⚡️
	const { data: { news } } = useNewsQuery()

	return <div>{news.map(...)}</div>
}
```

By default `**/*.graphqls` is recognized as GraphQL schema and `**/*.graphql` as GraphQL documents. If you prefer the other extensions, make sure the settings of the webpack loader in `next.config.js` and `.graphql-let.yml` are consistent.

## Deploy to netlify

Deploys are working via netlify, but not vercel. Vercel's config for nextjs for including additional necessary files (lib/\*.graphqls) for the lambda function doesn't work. Netlify's does, see netlify.toml. Additional config info here: https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/common-configurations/next-js/
